    <p>My name is Martez Conner, and for over a year now I have been learning and working freelance web development. At a young age I was told that if you're going to get into a job at least make it a job that you'll love, and that will not be considered job at all. I see building websites and engineering programs as a passion.</p>
    <p>Theres's no greater passion than finding a solution to a once difficult problem with your code. In which you had to take a step back, and see it from a different perspective. Just like the feeling when everything you've built integrates together and your project being ready to deploy for the world to see. In the end I don't recognize web development as job, but to me it is something I love and something I want to learn more about.</p>
    <p>I am very dedicated, hardworking, and diligent in my line of work. I know that I am ready to work along with like minded individuals who share this same passion with me. I have been learning and practicing web development basics for two years at this point in time. I have knowledge in many technologies the bulk of my knowledge being focused on JavaScript development using NodeJs with a framework like Angular 2+ or using a library such as React. For PHP, the framework that I have completed some work in is Laravel which is a very great framework for the language in my opinion. I currently live in the Bay Area, and am anxious for the opportunity to meet the team I will be working with. If you are part of that team then thank you for being a part of the journey with me.</p>
