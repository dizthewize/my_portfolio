    <div className="about-text">
    <p> My name is Martez Conner, and for almost two years now I have been working in web development. I have knowledge in a few development technologies the bulk of my knowledge is focused on JavaScript development including Node JS along with using a library such as React to handle the frontend side of my projects or using a framework like Angular 2+.</p>
    <p> At a young age I was told that if you're going to get into a job at least make it a job that you'll love, and it will not be considered a job at all. I love development with a passion thereâ€™s no greater passion than finding a solution to a once difficult problem with your code. There would be obstacles through which at some point you had to take a step back and see it from a different perspective. Just like the feeling when everything you've built integrates together and your project being ready to deploy for the world to see. In the end I don't recognize web development as job, but to me it is something I love and something I want to learn more about.</p>
    <p> I am very dedicated, hardworking, and diligent in my line of work. I currently live in the Bay Area and I am anxious for the opportunity to meet a team I will be working with. If you are part of that team then thank you for being a part of the journey with me.</p>
