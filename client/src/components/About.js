    <p>My name is Martez Conner, and for over a year now I have been learning and working freelance web development. At a young age I was told that if you're going to get into a job at least make it a job that you'll love, and that will not be considered job at all.I see building websites and engineering programs as not only a somewhat newfound passion, but I have always wanted to find my niche in life and I now know that I've found it.</p>
    <p>Theres's no greater passion when finding a solution to a once difficult problem with your code. In which you had to take a step back, and see it from a different perspective. Just like the feeling when everything you've built integrates together and it being ready to deploy for the world to see. In the end I don't recognize web development as job, but to me it is something I love and something I want to learn more about.</p>
    <p>I am a very dedicated and hardworking individual, but to me that's not enough in this line of work. I know that I am ready to work along with like minded individuals who share this same passion with me. I am currently skilled in the basics which are, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I have both knowledge in NodeJs and PHP with a greater focus on React and NodeJs. For front end with Node.Js I work with ReactJS and have built many applications using the two hand in hand with each other. For PHP, the framework that I focus my work with is Laravel which is a very great framework for the language in my opinion. I currently live in the Bay Area, and am anxious for the opportunity to meet the team I will be working with. If you are part of that team then thank you for being a part of the journey with me.</p>
